        <!-- 3) Here we link the CSS file I (the instructor) wrote to help out. It adjusts the size of the h1, positions the table in the bottom left, positions the h1 in the top left, positions the background image along the center left and stretches to cover the page, puts a semi-transparent background on the table, adds the borders between the rows on the table, and picks a better default font for the td's. Don't change this line or the CSS unless you want to clean up those things yourself -->
